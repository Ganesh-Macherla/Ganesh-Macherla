## Hi there, Machu here! 👋
### *Sleepy fundamentalist, but i will steal, analyize and make something of my own, if its interesting.*

I’m a CS sophomore specializing in IoT with a wide curiosity for technology as a whole.
I care about fundamentals, experimentation, and understanding systems beyond the surface.
Slow but a Stubborn learner.

## 🚀 Direction

I’m strengthening my core CS foundation while exploring AI and Machine Learning.

My long-term goal is to work at the intersection of intelligent systems,
distributed networks, and real-world engineering.

Right now I’m focused on:

- Data Structures & Algorithms
- AI / Machine Learning fundamentals
- Systems thinking & IoT optimization
- Or simply anything which intrigues me

## 📄 Research

### Reliability-Aware Asynchronous Federated Learning (RA-AFL)  
*A Cross-Layer Optimization for Heterogeneous IoFT Networks*

Research focused on improving reliability and efficiency in federated learning
across heterogeneous Internet-of-Federated-Things environments.

📄 A basic idea : [Read the paper](./ra-afl_idea.pdf)

## 💻 What I’m Working On

- **DSA practice** — strengthening logic step by step
- **IoT exploration** — hardware + software integration
- **Learning projects** — small builds that teach big lessons

I believe breaking things is part of understanding them.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Curiosity > speed  
Consistency > perfection  
Understanding > memorization

I’m not rushing mastery.  
I’m building it.
